- **Links between COVID-19 lockdowns and drug overdose deaths, evidence from panel data.** *Economics and Human Biology*, 2025 
 — Abstract: This paper studies the impacts of divergent state government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic on drug overdose deaths. Using Difference-in-Differences method, I exploit the cross-state variation in the timing of lockdown policies to examine how COVID-19 lockdowns affected drug overdose deaths. To the author's knowledge, this is the first study that comprehensively examines the causal links between COVID-19 lockdowns and drug overdose deaths in the US. 
By emphasizing the impacts of lockdown "mandates" vs. "recommendations," I find credible evidence supporting that the implementation of lockdown mandates led to more drug overdose deaths. My baseline estimates indicate a 15% to 20% increase in drug overdose deaths. To make my results generalizable, I examine three potential mechanisms, including labor market outcomes, mental health, and isolation. I find that isolation induced by the COVID-19 lockdown mandates likely contributes to the increase in drug overdose deaths, while there is only weak evidence that labor market outcomes and mental health serve as plausible channels.

## Working Papers
- **Effects of Minneapolis Upzoning on House Prices: Evidence from the Minneapolis 2040 Plan** with Alexander Marsella, Vitor Melo  — Abstract: The Minneapolis 2040 Plan, which came into effect in January 2020, introduced sweeping reforms to housing regulations. One of the most significant aspect of the Plan is the relaxation of zoning regulations, especially the first single-family zoning ban in any major US city. The effects of the Plan on house prices remain understudied.  
Exploiting a rich set of house price data from Zillow.com, we find a significant reduction in house price increases in Minneapolis following the Plan. Our baseline estimates suggest a 15% to 23% reduction in mid-tier house price growth. The credibility of our identification could be compromised by contemporaneous shocks in 2020, including the George Floyd protests and the changes in housing demand driven by the shift to work-from-home arrangements. We further adopt falsification tests examining these effects. 
Combining our results and past studies, we demonstrate credible evidence that the Plan improves housing affordability. 
We find mixed evidence on the quantity of new housing construction as measured in housing units, while the increase in new housing density is ubiquitous, suggesting higher density is likely a main driver of the reduction in housing value growth.
Our primary findings are robust to a range of alternative assumptions, including using alternative data, adopting alternative functional forms, varying trend assumptions, and the inclusion of city-specific time trends.

- **Impacts of the COVID-19 Pandemic on Women's Health: New Evidence from BRFSS** with Daniel Grossman — Abstract: Covid-19 pandemic is the most severe public health crisis in decades. The pandemic and the following recession deepened gender disparities. Now that it has been five years since the onset of the pandemic, we present a comprehensive analysis of its effects on gender disparities. Exploiting rich data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and American Time Use Survey Data, we provide holistic examinations on the gender disparities in self-reported health after COVID. We find that COVID-19 worsened women's general health, as measured on a Likert scale, and also negatively impacted women's mental health, increasing severe mental illness by 3%. This pattern is unique compared to the prior recession. However, the impacts of COVID-19 on physical health is less obvious. We examine potential mechanism through changes in time allocation, health care access, and health behaviors during COVID that might affect women's health. Contradict to previous studies, we find little evidence that the extra burdens on childcare explain the gender disparities. Instead, we propose alternative channels—such as changes in time use and health behaviors—that may contribute to the post-COVID health disparities. Our results are robust to alternative functional forms, contemporaneous controls, and COVID lockdown policies.
