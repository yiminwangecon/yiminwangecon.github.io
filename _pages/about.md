Welcome to my web page! I am a PhD student in Economics at West Virginia University. I hold a MS in Economics from University of Maine and a BS in Economics from University of Central Arkansas. 

My research focuses on applied microeconomics, including health economics, labor economics, population economics, and urban economics.
